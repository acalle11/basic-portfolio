            <p><img src="profile.jpg" />Hi I am Alex! 
                I currently help school districts, municipalities, and other public entities comply with federal audits. 
                When I am not busy punching numbers, you will find me in a gym, outside doing outdoorsy activities, or face deep in a book.
                Keeping my mind active and challenging myself is something I strive for everyday.</p>
                
            <p> Having grown up in Chicago, I got the big city big dreams mindset. 
                The skyscrapers, the monuments, and lights struck me in awe ever since I was a boy. 
                I marveled at the amount of human ingenuity it took to create such structures. 
                Creation in my opinion is the essence of life. 
                Without creation we have no growth and when something stops growing well I am sure you know what happens.
                That realization is what has drawn me to web development. 
                To be able to create an application and see it come to fruition would be incredible. 
                I am pumped to make an impact on the world!</p>
